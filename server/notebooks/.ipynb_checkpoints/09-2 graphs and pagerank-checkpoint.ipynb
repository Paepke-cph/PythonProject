    "# What is a Graph?\n",
    "A graph is a pictorial representation of a set of objects where some pairs of objects are connected by links. The interconnected objects are represented by points termed as vertices, and the links that connect the vertices are called edges.  \n",
    "\n",
    "![](images/graph.jpg)\n",
    "## Terminology\n",
    "- **Vertex** or **Node** − Each element of the graph is represented as a vertex. In the above example, the labeled circle represents vertices. Thus, A to G are vertices. We can represent them using an array as shown in the following image. Here A can be identified by index 0. B can be identified using index 1 and so on.\n",
    "- **Edge** − Edge represents a path between two vertices or a line between two vertices. In the following example, the lines from A to B, B to C, and so on represents edges. We can use a two-dimensional array to represent an array as shown above. Thus AB can be represented as 1 at row 0, column 1, BC as 1 at row 1, column 2 and so on, keeping other combinations as 0.\n",
    "- **Adjacency** − Two node or vertices are adjacent if they are connected to each other through an edge. In the above example, B is adjacent to A, C is adjacent to B, and so on.\n",
    "- **Path** − Path represents a sequence of edges between the two vertices. In the above example, ABCD represents a path from A to D.\n",
    "- **Weight** Edges may be weighted, illustrating the 'price' of moving from one Vertex to another (like the road length from one city to another.\n",
    "- **cyclic vs acyclic** If a graph is cyclic it means that there are one ore more path that starts at a vertex and end at the same vertex.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Undirected Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A *graph* $G$ consists of a nonempty set, $V(G)$, called the *vertices* of $G$, and a set $E(G)$ called the *edges* of $G$.  \n",
    "\n",
    "An element of $E(G)$ is an *undirected* edge or simply an \"edge\". An undirected edge has two vertices $u\\neq v$ called its endpoints. Such an edge can be represented by the two element set $\\{u, v\\}$. The notation $\\langle u—v \\rangle$ denotes this edge.\n",
    "Both $\\langle u—v \\rangle$ and $\\langle v—u \\rangle$ define the same undirected edge, whose endpoints are $u$ and $v$.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/graph_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, let $H$ be the graph pictured in Figure above. The vertices of $H$\n",
    "correspond to the nine dots, that is, $V(H) = \\{a,b,c,d,e,f,g,h,i\\}$\n",
    "\n",
    "The edges correspond to the eight lines, that is,\n",
    "\n",
    "$E(H) = \\big\\{\\langle a—b \\rangle,\\langle a—c \\rangle,\\langle b—d \\rangle,\\langle c—d \\rangle,\\langle c—e \\rangle,\\langle e—f \\rangle,\\langle e—g \\rangle,\\langle h—i \\rangle\\big\\} $\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Directed Graphs\n",
    "\n",
    "A *directed graph* -or *digraph*- $G$ consists of a nonempty set $V(G)$, called the vertices of $G$, and a set $E(G)$, called the edges of $G$. An element of $E(G)$ is called a *directed edge*. A directed edge is also called an \"arrow\" or simply an \"edge\". A directed edge starts at some vertex $u$ called the *tail* of the edge, and ends at some vertex $v$ called the *head* of the edge.\n",
    "\n",
    "![](./images/digraph_example.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "### Vertex Degrees\n",
    "\n",
    "The *in-degree* of a vertex in a digraph is the number of arrows coming into it, and similarly its *out-degree* is the number of arrows out of it.\n",
    "\n",

    "**PageRank** was one of the original ideas that set Google's search apart from other Web search engines when it was introduced in 1997.\n",
    "\n",
    "PageRank was invented to solve the problem of term-frequency (TF) tyranny: if we are searching for `IBM`, how do we make sure that the *first* result is IBM's website, and not a random page that mentioned `IBM` more frequently?\n",
    "\n",
    "The idea is that ibm.com has many in-links (links to the page) so it should be ranked higher.\n",
    "Each in-link is a vote for the quality of the linked-to page. But if we only count in-links it would be possible for a web spammer to create a network of pages and have them all point to his page, increasing the score of his page. \n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore the PageRank algorithm is designed to weight links from high-quality sites more heavily. A high-quality site is one that is linked to by other high-quality sites.\n",
